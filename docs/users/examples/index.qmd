This section is devoted to demonstrating the basic capabilities in Quarto. The examples focus mainly on how to:

- Create a basic template.
- Display images, tables, code.
- Without an attached language, without Python and R.

By clicking on **Edit this page**, it's possible to view the source code of the qmd file generating this page.

When using Python with Quarto to generate output, it internally first creates a Jupyter notebook with the extension `.ipynb`, which is then run and generated into html. This step can be bypassed and one can still write Jupyter notebooks, and have them rendered directly.

Even though our examples focus on `qmd` files, you can use Quarto to render Jupyter notebook files (`.ipynb`). Check out their [documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/jupyter.html) for more info.
